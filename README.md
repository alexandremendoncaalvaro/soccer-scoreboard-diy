# Inspiration and attributions
This project was strongly inspired by the project [7-Segment Digital Clock](https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel/7-Segment-Digital-Clock-V2).  
Licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

We've started building our project from scratch and used pieces of the 7-Segment Digital Clock code to quickly test and adapt it to our scenario. During this process, a new code was created and a good part of the 7-Segment Digital Clock original code was refactored. But most of the concepts and functionalities remain.  
Special thanks to [Leon van den Beukel](https://github.com/leonvandenbeukel) for the amazing work.
